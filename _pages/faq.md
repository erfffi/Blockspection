<h3 style="text-align: center;">Should You Consider Reviews As An Investment Advise?</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Not at all. The main and only purpose of these reviews are for educational purposes. Each individual is responsible to do their own due diligence before they invest.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Do You Charge Your Audience For The Reviews?</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">No, we do not charge our subscribers for the reviews, but we appreciate any donations.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Do You Charge Companies In Order To Post a Good Review About Them?</h3>
